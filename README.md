| [PORTUGUESE](./README-pt-BR.md)

Python for the analysis of estuaries

The objective of this project is to give back to the community the knowledge acquired
on the net through projects, scripts and examples shared by third parties.

The project is structured as follows:

     * "estuarpy": the code itself
         
     * "data":  the necessary data to run the examples:
        
     * "samples": the figures output
